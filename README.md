# Optimal-Ad-Timing-from-Sales-Trends

### Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

## Environment Setup
#### To replicate and run the Sales Analysis project, the following tools and libraries are required:Tools: Python 3.8+: The project is written in Python, so make sure you have Python installed. Jupyter Notebook: A great environment for running and presenting data analysis projects.

## Libraries:

### Install the following libraries using pip:

## terminal :- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

#### Pandas: For handling and manipulating the sales dataset

### NumPy: For numerical operations

### Matplotlib: For plotting graphs to visualize sales trends

### Seaborn: To generate advanced visualizations

### Scikit-learn: For any machine learning models you may include.

## Dataset:

### Make sure the sales dataset is available in your working directory. The dataset should include fields like Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Price Each, Order Date, and Purchase Address.

## Steps to Run:

### 1.Clone the project repository or download the project files

### 2.Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory

## We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

#### Drop NaN values from DataFrame

#### Removing rows based on a condition

#### Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

## Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:


#### What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

#### What city sold the most product?

#### What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?

#### What products are most often sold together?

#### What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

## To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods.
### They include: Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)

#### Adding columns

#### Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)

#### Using the .apply() method

#### Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis

#### Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results

#### Labeling our graphs
